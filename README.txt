Add custom icon fonts from Fontello to the built in Cornerstone and Pro elements controls

== Description ==

Enables the user to add their own custom icons to the built in Cornerstone and Pro Theme icon controls and elements, thereby removing the reliance on FontAwesome and providing a better opportunity for branding with custom icon sets on your websites. Works exclusively through the use of Fontello's free icon font service.

= Plugin Features =
 
*   Add unlimited icons and SVG icons to your website through Fontello's free service
*   Upload multiple icon packs from Fontello
*   View the icons in each uploaded pack, delete individually if desired
*   Use icons anywhere you would normally with the default Cornerstone icon selector

Please note, this plugin requires the Cornerstone Page Builder (or the Pro Theme by Themeco) to be installed and active. [Cornerstone on CodeCanyon](https://codecanyon.net/item/cornerstone-the-wordpress-page-builder/15518868). [Pro by Themeco](https://theme.co/pro/)

This plugin relies on a third party service for it's functionality provided by [Fontello](http://fontello.com). No private information is sent to their server, rather their provided webfont downloads are what's used to add fonts to this plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What can I do with this plugin? =

You can add your own icons to the Cornerstone and Pro builders. From exisiting fonts to totally custom SVG icons, no more messing around with CSS or image elements. It's now all baked in.

= Can I upload more than one Fontello package to a single site? =

You bet! Upload as many as you like, they will all work. However, there are a couple tips to make it work better: 1) make sure you give each font a unique name (text box beside the Fontello download button). 2) Edit the unicode values on each font to be different. This step is a little time consuming, but by default, Fontello starts most new fonts with E800, which will cause a conflict when you upload more than one package.

= HELP! It doesnt work?! =

There is a small, small chance this plugin may not work on your web host. This is caused by two things generally: a mod_security rule flagging the ZIP upload, or the lack of PHP libraries needed to unzip files. Here's the good news: your host can fix both of these easily. If they refuse, consider moving to a more modern host.
